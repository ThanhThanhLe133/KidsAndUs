                        <p>Notwithstanding the above, due to its content, the website may be attractive to said minors.
                            In this regard, KIDS&US encourages parents to monitor their children’s electronic
                            activities, for example by means of the use of the parental control tools provided by
                            several electronic services and software manufacturers, helping to provide a secure
                            electronic environment for minors.</p>
                        <p>Said tools may also prevent children under fourteen (14) years of age from electronically
                            communicating their names, addresses and other personal data without their parents’ consent.
                        </p>
                        <p>KIDS&US reserves the right to verify, by the means it deems most appropriate, the actual age
                            of any User who has disclosed data via the website and, if appropriate, to deny said User
                            access to the services on offer, and proceed to his or her cancellation and elimination.
                            However, as it is extremely difficult to determine the actual age of the persons who
                            disclose data via the website, if you discover that one of your children has performed such
                            a disclosure, please contact KIDS&US at the following email address: info@kidsandus.com</p>
